<h3 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„ Hello! I'm James, welcome!</h3>

I spend time here in [my profile](https://github.com/colossus9?tab=repositories), but primarily I experiment and build within my [Garcia Lab organization](https://github.com/garcia-lab). Be sure to check it out!

Speaking, building, technical writing, and mentoring are among my professional passions. For one of my more recent talks, see this one on [ðŸŽ¥ unifying DevOps, DevSecOps, and CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDAAACY9m-8) along with my colleagues [@primetheus](https://github.com/primetheus) and [@jefeish](jefeish).
